      <h1>Failing, Flailing</h1>
      <p class="date"><span>10.29.2012</span></p>
      <section class="content"><p>I have had an anger problem for my entire life. In preschool, I was almost held back for a third year because I couldn&#39;t control my temper whenever I lost a game or experienced any setback at all[1]. More generally, I hated failure. I still&nbsp;do.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>So naturally, I&#39;ve become a programmer, where you can expect to fail dozens of times before you find the right solution to your problem, and even when you do find a solution, you can always find a <em>better</em> solution. I‘m pretty good at controlling my temper these days in public these days; in a newsroom or in a workplace, I might curse under my breath, but I’ll keep to myself as I work. Programming alone in my room is another story. I scream at my screen, punch pillows, pace around furiously, and generally flail around until I find a solution, especially when others are depending on my&nbsp;success.</p>
<p>Nothing has been more demanding on my ability to handle failure than working on <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern/">North by Northwestern</a>, where I serve as webmaster. I&#39;m responsible for everything regarding the frontend and backend of the site. If anything at all goes wrong, from an overflowing Twitter widget to extremely slow database queries, I hear about it and have to fix it promptly. Unfortunately, I took the position at a time when I was hardly qualified. I knew next to nothing about database management, and I had just begun working with Django, our web framework of choice. In the first two months of my tenure, I have already learned a ton. Eventually, everything always works out and I fix the problem, but it takes me a while to find a solution that may not be obviously apparent to me because <strong>I have no idea what I&#39;m doing.</strong> That problem is&nbsp;two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>We publish daily. Time is scarce. I need to find a solution, but first, I need to find the <em>problem</em>. As the wise sage Heather Billings <a href="https://twitter.com/hbillings/status/256775781517258753">once said</a>, “Programming is easy once you know what problem you actually need to&nbsp;solve.”</li>
<li>When I don&#39;t know what to do, I fail a lot, and I am dealing with sensitive data: six years of publishing history[2]. For me, the tension of executing any sort of process is unbearably stressful because of the consequences should something go&nbsp;wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally, I work on <span class="caps">NBN</span> when I have free time by myself. The stress of failing when dealing with a live site used by some of my closest friends and viewed by thousands of students is, at times, brutal. But in the end, all that stress is self-inflicted. It stems from an expectation of myself to be perfect all the time. No one has gotten angry with me about my performance (or at least they haven‘t told me about it). My perfectionism, especially in the field I’ve chosen for myself, is&nbsp;unhealthy.</p>
<p>Now that I‘ve familiarized myself with what I need to know regarding our Django app so that I can attack a problem swiftly, I have a new goal: I want to stabilize myself. I want to receive the email or phone call with a sense of calm and, instead of wasting energy and time on freaking out, go after the problem and accept that my first attempt at fixing it probably won’t work. I need to tell myself that everything will be okay. I have smart friends that can help me[3]. In the end, I always come out with some sort of solution, either a temporary amalgam of digital duct tape and glue or, eventually, a real, finished solution. I can do&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>[1]: My mother overruled because I knew how to read. Thanks, Mom.
[2]: I know, I know. Backup, backup, test, backup. I do. But still.
[3]: My smartest friends are called “Google” and&nbsp;“Twitter.”</p>
