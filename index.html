<p>Last week, I launched my first team-developed <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/housing">news app</a> with a group of amazing student news nerds and peers: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hil_fung">Hilary Fung</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/danhillreports">Dan Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kkrebeccalai">Rebecca Lai</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shenghis">Sheng Wu</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ktzhu">Katie Zhu</a>. We developed <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/housing">a housing guide</a> for incoming freshmen to Northwestern University who are in the process of applying for freshman housing. It includes an interactive map of campus, filters to narrow down housing options, photos and videos of each hall, quotes from current residents and basic statistics including number of students, room size, cost and distance to key campus&nbsp;locations.</p>

<p>For about seven months, I have been developing <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/">my college publication’s</a> homebrew Django-based <span class="caps">CMS</span> (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.django-cms.org/">django-cms</a>). I suppose “maintain” would be the more appropriate word; I didn’t actually build the <span class="caps">CMS</span>. Instead, I’ve added a few features, subtracted a few useless ones and optimized for performance. These days, it works well, and my editors know how to use it effectively. But I’m&nbsp;frustrated.</p>

<p>Was Computation + Journalism an academic conference or an industry conference? It&#39;s hard to say, especially when nearly every panel through its two days featured a working journalist and an educator, and an equally diverse audience pressed questions from many ends of the field. Unsurprisingly, the debates that came to the fore early and often centered around that intersection between educators and practicing journalists. As a student in a journalism school, I paid special attention to the discussion around what students should be learning in journalism school to prepare them for becoming a practicing&nbsp;journalist.</p>
